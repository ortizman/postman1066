# Intro
This is just a workaround for the never solved issue 
https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/1066 by postman

# What does it solve?

Displays the collection in the form of a tree (similar to postman). Features:
* Multiple selection (and by range using the shift key)
* Drag and Drop (for multiple selection)
* Delete all selected items
* Export result (the original collection is not modified)

Then, just import the new collection into postman. 

**RECOMMENDATION:** Import the new collection as a copy.
